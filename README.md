DataBased - A Hip-Hop Data Set
==============================
DataBased is a set of scripts that will scrape a hip-hop dataset to be used at your discretion. 
If you do not want to build your own set, exported collections can be found in JSON format in the `Raw_JSON` archive. 
To build the set in MongoDB, see INSTRUCTIONS.md.
